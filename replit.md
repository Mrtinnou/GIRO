# Overview

This is a Smart Waste Collection Management system designed to optimize waste collection routes and monitor bin status in real-time. The application provides a web-based interface with an interactive map for visualizing waste bin locations, their fill levels, and optimized collection routes. The system aims to improve efficiency in waste management operations through intelligent routing and real-time monitoring.
